            "[54:14.060 --> 54:20.640]  the harbor explosion of 2020. It is still not rebuilt and the incompetence of the current\n",
            "[54:21.400 --> 54:30.760]  Lebanese government is visible immediately. There is no electricity there is no water\n",
            "[54:30.760 --> 54:39.120]  and I would like to reiterate what Mohammed said earlier about that how the camps are under siege\n",
            "[54:39.120 --> 54:44.040]  because this is also an important aspect. In some camps like Shatila the\n",
            "[54:44.040 --> 54:50.820]  the distinction between the camp and the surrounding slum is a bit blurred but even\n",
            "[54:50.820 --> 54:58.940]  then the camps function as or they are sort of a center of poverty in the urban areas\n",
            "[54:58.940 --> 55:06.400]  and there is a wall built around the camps of course so one moment you're walking into a very\n",
            "[55:06.400 --> 55:12.020]  poor neighborhood in Lebanon where the effects of the crisis are very visible but as soon as you\n",

            "[55:18.640 --> 55:25.020]  in the camps face becomes immediately visible for example the canopy of electrician cables\n",
            "[55:25.020 --> 55:29.880]  because the Lebanese government forbids people in the camps to build their own infrastructure\n",

            "[55:42.020 --> 55:51.580]  and in this sense also the um excuse me uh in this sense also uh\n",
            "[55:56.960 --> 56:03.880]  sorry I'm I'm blacking out for a sec um but yeah the oppression is very visible um and\n",
            "[56:04.520 --> 56:11.900]  we can also see the the role of uh the imperialist institutions in the camps we can also see the role\n",
            "[56:12.020 --> 56:19.780]  of Arab reaction in the camps. There is much discrimination. For example, Ain al-Halwi camp\n",
            "[56:19.780 --> 56:30.100]  has a military checkpoint surrounding the entire camp. These camps exist for 70 something years\n",
            "[56:30.100 --> 56:34.980]  and even still the people in the camps are not considered to be full citizens of the Lebanese\n",
            "[56:34.980 --> 56:43.940]  state. So this means that they cannot have jobs, they cannot provide an income and are thus\n",
            "[56:49.220 --> 56:54.020]  excuse me, what's the word I'm looking for? They're dependent on donations, for example,\n",
            "[56:54.020 --> 57:02.660]  by United Nations institutions, the UNWRA, which are incompetent institutions and it's very physical\n",
            "[57:02.660 --> 57:04.940]  to see that. Their schools are not for\n",
            "[57:04.980 --> 57:08.300]  a settlement of the Jews. Their hospitals are not functioning properly, so it's up to\n",
            "[57:08.300 --> 57:13.340]  revolutionary organizations, it's up to these youth organizations that we met and who we were\n",
            "[57:13.340 --> 57:19.340]  honored to be invited to see the work that they're doing, to fill in the gaps, so to speak.\n",
            "[57:22.220 --> 57:32.860]  Because they have to be steadfast. In a way this is very inspiring to see, first of all.\n",
            "[57:34.220 --> 57:34.940]  On the other side.\n",
            "[57:34.980 --> 57:40.020]  it also shows there are still lots to be done and it also shows the importance for international\n",
            "[57:40.020 --> 57:48.980]  organizations to provide this political support which works in both directions not just euros\n",
            "[57:48.980 --> 57:54.980]  and dollars like Mohamed said but political support and agitating for the right of return and\n",
            "[57:54.980 --> 58:00.180]  this is also of course why the Masar Wadil conference is so important because the right\n",
            "[58:00.180 --> 58:09.300]  of return is it should be one of the top priorities of course so in conclusion the role of\n",
            "[58:10.900 --> 58:18.260]  well maybe in Palestine itself when we look at the colonization that's going on\n",
            "[58:18.260 --> 58:25.540]  on the surface level you see the Zionist entity and the Palestinian people on the one on\n",
            "[58:25.540 --> 58:30.100]  two sides and in the camps we can also see very clearly\n",
            "[58:30.180 --> 58:38.340]  the role of the imperialist powers and their puppets in the Arab reaction which are definitely\n",
            "[58:38.340 --> 58:42.180]  playing a major role in oppression and in oppressing the Palestinian people in the camps\n",
            "[58:42.180 --> 58:48.180]  and preventing and trying to prevent them from organizing and from struggling for their political\n",
            "[58:48.180 --> 58:57.780]  rights yeah anybody can film you on of course if you felt that I left something out but\n",

            "[59:06.500 --> 59:12.100]  to share some things about what you experienced and saw in Shatila camp I mean one of the things\n",
            "[59:12.100 --> 59:16.740]  about this delegation was that it was making a point to connect and build bridges with different\n",
            "[59:16.740 --> 59:22.180]  organizations and this is something that I think many people have have spoken about and you know\n",
            "[59:22.180 --> 59:27.540]  during the time in Lebanon folks met with many different organizations political organizations\n",

            "[59:47.700 --> 59:55.620]  happening there yes thank you Charlotte yeah just very very briefly also to come back to the\n",
            "[59:55.620 --> 59:59.700]  organization that Hadiya mentioned that's the chess center in\n",

            "[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:22.900]  but it is an educational political center where the kids themselves are actually running the\n",
            "[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:30.180]  center and they are the the body who elects a board and who makes the daily decisions\n",

            "[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.120]  But still you see that they are building\n",

            "[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:50.180]  And as well, we visited the Mlita,\n",

            "[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.780]  So, this was a very important educational day\n",

            "[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.600]  But, at the same time, it was very important for them to be on,\n",

            "[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:39.260]  But this, in order to implement such a trip, this is expensive in the time of a crisis of gasoline and diesel and transportation and electricity.\n",
            "[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:47.320]  In the time of crisis, economic crisis, these organizations are able and struggling to do this.\n",
            "[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.360]  This means they are working very hard to do this.\n",
            "[01:03:50.360 --> 01:04:00.200]  And I think one of our roles as Samidoun, as different organizations, and some of you who are attending now with us, is to support this kind of delegation.\n",
            "[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.840]  This is investment in our youth. This is investment in our new generation.\n",
            "[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:11.340]  So this is, I think, where we should go and support this kind of work.\n",
            "[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:16.420]  Tomorrow, Al-Naqab Center in Burj Al-Barajin camp is organizing as well.\n",

            "[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:31.060]  So we see also these efforts have been done by youth who are building those organizations to deliver this education and to work directly with our new generations.\n",
            "[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:43.880]  We think this should be our priority as well as Palestinians community in diaspora and also solidarity groups with Palestine to support this example of resistance in Lebanon.\n",
            "[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.020]  Thank you so much.\n",

            "[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.120]  And we're receiving a number of questions as well.\n",
            "[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:58.840]  So I'd like to transition into talking about some of the questions that were getting sent to us as well.\n",
            "[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:07.340]  One question that has been asked is that we've heard a lot about the role of Palestinian youth in the camps in Lebanon.\n",
            "[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:13.440]  But there's also a question about the role of Palestinian women and what is the situation that Palestinians are experiencing.\n",
            "[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:20.880]  What are the challenges that Palestinian women are facing today in the camps and how are they organizing and participating in struggle?\n",
            "[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:27.180]  I don't know if Khadiyah, you would like to speak to this.\n",
            "[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.240]  Do you want to talk a little bit and then I'll go?\n",
            "[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.140]  Yes.\n",

            "[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.920]  Today, the women in the camps are facing a lot of challenges.\n",
            "[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:52.020]  The Palestinian women in the camps are generally not in a safe place like any other place, like the children and the children's homes.\n",
            "[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:57.280]  And of course, women are not in a safe environment.\n",
            "[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:08.920]  Today, there are centers that work with Palestinian women in the camps, like the Center for Solidarity in the Al-Hilwa Camp,\n",
            "[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.920]  which was running...\n",
            "[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:11.920]  or which is running...\n",

            "[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.520]  Go ahead.\n",
            "[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.660]  As I was talking about the Center for Solidarity in the Al-Hilwa Camp,\n",
            "[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:41.140]  unfortunately, we need more centers in the camps that are general,\n",
            "[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.700]  to work with women.\n",
            "[01:06:42.920 --> 01:07:11.440]  the Palestinian women inside the camps in Lebanon are not in a safe space, such as the\n",
            "[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:18.480]  children's, the youth, like the general situation that the Palestinians live in collectively,\n",
            "[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:25.940]  but also we witness, for example, at the Daman Center, the social solidarity institution in\n",
            "[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:32.300]  the camp, how they are delivering kind of training ships, providing a safe space for the woman to\n",
            "[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:41.200]  organize and to give her skills and many other stuff. I think that also we must support more\n",
            "[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.940]  different organizations, because there is a need for more organizations in the camps to be\n",
            "[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.640]  providing the safe space for women.\n",
            "[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.340]  Well, I wanted to add something, just in case you want to translate, please.\n",
            "[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:11.020]  Well, the truth is that I wanted to highlight the role that the women have played in the camps,\n",
            "[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:18.160]  the hairstylists and women of the camp. We have talked a lot about the role that we have played\n",

            "[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.340]  we have been talking a lot about the role that the women have played,\n",
            "[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:35.760]  for example, in the Palestinian resistance, and since the beginning of the colonial state, but we would also have to talk about the role female women play in the nonetheless autistic society.\n",
            "[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.300]  Since the culmination, ways that the Palestinian women have spoken a lot, that we would also have to talk about the role that women plays in the Palestinian各 competitiveness within gender norms,'\n",
            "[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.300]  How they have supported the transitions that women have had.\n",

            "[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:41.560]  and point. I think I totally agree with you. I do believe that the camps, they need cooperative,\n",
            "[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.960]  and they need to be independent economically in the way that they are struggling for their\n",

            "[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:57.960]  for the camps in Lebanon. If you walk inside the Ayn al-Halwi camp, they will show you, for example,\n",

            "[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:22.040]  But also the current problem today, I think, is staying as an obstacle to build this kind\n",

            "[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:04.980]  If you want to read an interview with Ellen, I'm going to put a link in the chat for that for everyone as well.\n",
            "[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.160]  Recommending.\n",
            "[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:17.800]  The work of another organization called Beit Atfala Samud, which, you know, is active in many of the camps and organizes a yearly commemoration for Sabra and Shatila as well.\n",
            "[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:24.340]  And so thank you to, thank you to Ellen for joining us today for this event.\n",
            "[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:33.900]  And we're, we're very happy that you're with us and continuing your involvement in this internationalist struggle for Palestinian liberation and for justice.\n",
            "[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.300]  And for justice for Palestinians.\n",
            "[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.140]  And for the Palestinian refugees, including the right to return.\n",
            "[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:45.920]  So this final question that I'd like to present is about kind of where we go from here.\n",
            "[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:47.080]  What are the next steps?\n",
            "[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.800]  And so that is, will there be more delegations to Lebanon?\n",
            "[01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:58.440]  As a broader question, you know, what will the work of, for example, Sami Dun look like in Lebanon in the future?\n",
            "[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:06.200]  But also, what do you view as the next steps that we need to take to continue to organize, to build on this work?\n",
            "[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:12.480]  And to struggle together for return and for liberation of Palestine from the river to the sea?\n",
            "[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:19.220]  Comrade Mohammed, would you like to speak to this?\n",
            "[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.640]  Yes, sure.\n",
            "[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:33.900]  Firstly, like about the Beit Atfala Samud, I personally grew up in Beit Atfala Samud.\n",
            "[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.400]  All my knowledge about the geography.\n",
            "[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:41.140]  Palestine, what is Oslo, what is Camp David, about my village.\n",
            "[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:46.400]  It was from Beit Atfala Samud, and it was a woman leading organization.\n",
            "[01:42:47.140 --> 01:43:00.660]  And this was one of the only organizations in the camp in the time of 2000s that were not separating boys from girls and working together in a natural, healthy atmosphere.\n",
            "[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:06.400]  So I also recommend anyone to support and to communicate with Beit Atfala Samud.\n",
            "[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:12.140]  And thank you for bringing this up and for participating in this event.\n",
            "[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:24.140]  What we can do in the next steps, I think, of course, we should organize for every chapter for Sami Dun, Sweden, Netherlands, Spain.\n",
            "[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:30.140]  I think we should have our local programs, how we can build up over this experience.\n",
            "[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:33.140]  I think we have to work on the relations and connections that we created during this time.\n",
            "[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.140]  I think we have to work on the relations and connections that we created during this time.\n",
            "[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:36.140]  I think we have to work on the relations and connections that we created during this time.\n",
            "[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:37.020]  We don't have to communicate with the delegations.\n",
            "[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.900]  We have to keep in communication with the organizations that we are working with\n",
            "[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:41.140]  We have to keep in communication with the organizations that we are working with\n",
            "[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:43.140]  But also to provide a joint program where we can work together.\n",
            "[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.680]  But also to provide a joint program where we can work together.\n",
            "[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.020]  But also to provide a joint program where we can work together.\n",
            "[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:51.140]  How it looks like in Lebanon, I think\n",
            "[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.140]  as Samidoune is also a network that I welcome organizations to be part of.\n",
            "[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.140]  as Samidoune is also a network that I welcome organizations to be part of.\n",
            "[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.140]  as Samidoune is also a network that I welcome organizations to be part of.\n",
            "[01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:01.140]  I think all the organizations, most of them that we met,\n",
            "[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.780]  we are already working together.\n",
            "[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:05.020]  They joined Samidoune campaigns and started a development.\n",
            "[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:05.640]  They joined Samidoune campaigns and started a development.\n",
            "[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:11.640]  campaigns. They mobilized for George Ibrahim Abdullah. So I think it's the role of Samidoun\n",
            "[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:17.800]  as well to come up now after the delegation and after we have this understanding of our existence\n",
            "[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:24.600]  in Lebanon to provide a certain way of campaigning that can give the opportunity for our people to\n",
            "[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:31.200]  get involved, maybe different than how we are organizing in the West. Maybe we are cooperating\n",
            "[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:36.400]  with a different atmosphere and nature and environment. So I think also it's our role\n",
            "[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:43.120]  as an internationalist and solidarity group and as Samidoun chapters to look not in the way that\n",
            "[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:49.900]  how we organize, in a way that how other people organize locally and to adopt our struggle with\n",
            "[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:57.560]  them. So I think it's very important for Samidoun to support when this organization is organizing\n",
            "[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.180]  youth trips and delegations to the border.\n",
            "[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:10.440]  This could be very important for Samidoun to facilitate for Palestinian children and youth\n",
            "[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:16.680]  to go to al-Khiyam camp and to Ansar camp to preserve our memory. It's very important for\n",
            "[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:23.240]  Samidoun to connect the Palestinian prisoners' struggle inside Palestine, to create leaflets and\n",
            "[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:29.560]  books in Arabic and different languages to speak about who is those prisoners and how they are\n",
            "[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.540]  struggling and how the struggle is taking place.\n",
            "[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:31.040]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:31.180]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:36.840]  The struggle of our people in the refugee camps is connected with the struggle of the political\n",
            "[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:44.680]  prisoners inside the Zionist jails. It's connected with the struggle of our people inside this\n",
            "[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:50.760]  strip. It's connected with the struggle of our people inside West Bank. Of course, it's bad\n",
            "[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:56.120]  because it's segregated and sieged and we are speaking about the area, but this is our reality\n",
            "[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:01.020]  today as people in diaspora and as people from the refugee camps. We have\n",
            "[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:06.860]  to think together in this campaigning way for political prisoners because I think Samidoun is not\n",
            "[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:12.300]  only an organization or a network working on political prisoners. Of course, political prisoners\n",
            "[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:19.580]  is the main core of our work and mobilization, but also we focus on the right of return. But\n",
            "[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:25.340]  this is also why Samidoun is important because it's a network that is implementing our political\n",
            "[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:30.860]  discourse and our political opinions in our practices and in our joint programs. So I\n",
            "[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:36.140]  think this is how Samidoun should work in Lebanon. As well, Samidoun is playing a very important role\n",
            "[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:43.820]  in the alternative path. We are part of the local committee in Lebanon that are organizing also a\n",
            "[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:50.140]  local conference. Lebanon goes along with the conference in Madrid for the alternative path\n",
            "[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:56.940]  where we have in Lebanon more than today 15 local, very important organizations and political\n",
            "[01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:00.700]  movements are supporting this initiative. We are part of the local committee in Lebanon that are\n",
            "[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:03.580]  working on economic, social and humanitarian disparities in the region as well. So I think\n",
            "[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:09.260]  Samidoun should keep focusing on connecting with the Masar Badir. Connecting\n",
            "[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:14.700]  our internationalist comrades with the Palestinian comrades and provide this space where we\n",
            "[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:20.380]  all come together as an anti-imperialist front and struggling for the liberation of Palestine.\n",
            "[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:26.060]  So I think this is how Samidoun should connect and I think also the delegations shouldn't be\n",
            "[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:30.540]  also from Samidoun. Samidoun can play an important role to facilitate the\n",
            "[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:39.220]  get other delegates from other political organizations, social organizations, political groups to\n",
            "[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:45.280]  visit Lebanon and to have political programs there.\n",
            "[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.260]  Thank you so much, Kamrad.\n",
            "[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:54.220]  And Kamrad Kheldia, I'd like to turn to you as well.\n",
            "[01:47:54.220 --> 01:48:04.220]  Tom, would you like to go first then?\n",
            "[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:05.220]  Okay.\n",
            "[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:08.220]  Yes, Thomas, please go ahead.\n",
            "[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:12.220]  I'll go first and then I will.\n",
            "[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:19.220]  I mean, first of all, also continuing on what Mohammed was saying, I think we are all familiar\n",
            "[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:24.220]  and with the picture that was taken in the Senate.\n",
            "[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:31.220]  In the 60s, 70s of the Black Panther Party in the Lebanese camps.\n",
            "[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:40.980]  And I think in a way the solidarity movement in some ways has forgotten about Lebanon.\n",
            "[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:47.220]  So therefore this Samidoun delegation was also very important because of course we know\n",
            "[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:54.220]  even delegations going to Palestine itself, to see the crucial role of the diaspora and\n",
            "[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:57.220]  the people in Lebanon, this is very crucial.\n",
            "[01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:59.220]  And we should rebuild it.\n",
            "[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:06.220]  So yes, encourage all other organizations and people to also go to Lebanon and visit\n",
            "[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:10.220]  the Palestinian camps and the Palestinian organizations there.\n",
            "[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:15.220]  But there was just one thing I wanted to especially highlight, which is the case, of course, of\n",
            "[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:21.220]  George Ibrahim Abdallah, who is the Lebanese communist struggler for Palestine, who has\n",
            "[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.220]  been in prison now for more than 39 years.\n",
            "[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:28.220]  39 years in French prison, French prison for his resistance.\n",
            "[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:33.220]  Of course, he has fought in Lebanon against the Zionist armies.\n",
            "[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:38.220]  He has operated in Europe for the Palestinian resistance.\n",
            "[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:47.220]  And his case is a very, very concrete example of this historic and contemporary solidarity\n",
            "[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:52.220]  and interlinkage of the Lebanese and Palestinian and international community.\n",
            "[01:49:52.220 --> 01:50:02.220]  So I just wanted to mention that also October this month is the month to free George Ibrahim\n",
            "[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:11.220]  Abdallah, especially the collective Palestine Fancraad, the French comrades of Samidoun are\n",
            "[01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:16.220]  mobilizing a big demonstration later this month at the prison where George is.\n",
            "[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:20.220]  But also they have made a movie about George Abdallah.\n",
            "[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:23.220]  Fedayeen.\n",
            "[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:32.220]  There will be many movie screenings already planned, but also I would like to encourage everyone to organize a movie screening of Fedayeen.\n",
            "[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:36.220]  It's a documentary with lots of information.\n",
            "[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:44.220]  I know also Mohammed and Charlotte are also featured in the documentary itself.\n",
            "[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:48.220]  But just to, you know, make this.\n",
            "[01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:54.220]  This new movement that is growing is also continuing from the past.\n",
            "[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:58.220]  And George Abdullah is one of the people who was very much involved in this past.\n",
            "[01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:09.220]  And so it's important for us to keep continuing this red thread that has been going through the movement and that we can continue forward on.\n",
            "[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:14.220]  And to build a movement that will actually liberate George Ibrahim Abdallah.\n",
            "[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:17.220]  Because as we know, he is eligible for release since 99.\n",
            "[01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:23.220]  But the French authorities under pressure from, of course, the US and Israel are refusing to let him go.\n",
            "[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:32.220]  So we have to support him in the same way that he is from prison, supporting all of the progressive movements internationally and in the Arab world.\n",
            "[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:35.220]  So, yes, free George Ibrahim Abdallah.\n",
            "[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:37.220]  And please go ahead, Khaldia.\n",
            "[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:39.220]  Sorry, I took so much time.\n",
            "[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:44.220]  No, go ahead, Khaldia.\n",
            "[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:46.220]  Well, thank you very much, Tom.\n",
            "[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.220]  Thank you, Tom.\n",
            "[01:51:48.220 --> 01:52:04.220]  We couldn't miss the opportunity to talk about George because in October we are intensifying the fight for George Ibrahim Abdallah.\n",
            "[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:14.220]  Our comrades from Palestina Benjera will join us.\n",
            "[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:15.220]  Thank you.\n",
            "[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:16.220]  Thank you.\n",

            "[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:23.220]  The president is working constantly and day by day for the liberation of our comrades in Lebanon.\n",
